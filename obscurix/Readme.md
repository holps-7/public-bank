# 🗡️ **Obscurix — A Trail of Bytes, a Key in Disguise**

*Where code lies, secrets hide.*

---

## **The Story**

An innocuous Rust file was found drifting through a famous repo —
a file that looks ordinary at first glance, yet feels **wrong** the longer you stare.

Lines don’t match.
Comments don’t comment.
Symbols look just slightly out of place.
It’s as if someone took a real Rust module and **twisted** it until it resembled a cipher wearing a compiler’s skin.

Why disguise a message this way?
Why embed anything inside a source file that doesn't build?
That answer remains locked behind the fragments left behind.

The only certainty:

Someone hid something in the wreckage — **on purpose**.

## **Your Mission**

You are given a single resource:

```
obscurix.hex
```

This hex dump does **not** belong to a program.
It is merely the shell — the disguise.

Inside the obfuscated Rust lies:

* a challenge that only resolves once you’ve figured the **source** and reconstructed the whole `key`
* and finally, an instruction that waits to be invoked… if you can assemble the pieces.

The dump is your battlefield.
The fragments are your clues.
The scuffle begins now.

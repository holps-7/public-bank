# ShadowSBPF — sBPF Binary Forensics 🕵️‍♂️🖤

_Beneath the bytecode, a scrambled secret lies — uncover the pieces and reveal the flag._

---

## The Story

In a forgotten validator’s crate, an experimental sBPF program was compiled and sealed. An archivist with a mischievous streak hid a secret inside the compiled bytes — but not in an obvious form.

The program won’t run for you on-chain. It will, however, reveal hints to anyone who examines it closely: disassemble the code, inspect the data sections, and decode the scrambled fragments. The secret is there, patiently waiting for the right approach.

## Your Mission

Find the flag hidden inside the provided `4ydhoo090849724dugsfuwtfurt83rt83gr.so` sbpf binary.

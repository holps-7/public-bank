# 🏦 **American Bank**

Trust is built on paper. Paper burns.

## **The Situation**

A financial institution stands tall, its ledgers pristine and its vault secured.

The manager oversees everything with unwavering authority.  
The books balance perfectly.  
The surveillance systems report everything is in order.

But something feels... off.

Management is obsessed with one thing: **the numbers on paper**.  
That ledger is checked constantly — if it changes, alarms sound, investigators swarm, game over.

But the actual movement of value? The physical flow in and out?  
Nobody's watching. Not in real time.

Strange priorities for a bank. But exploitable.

## **What You Know**

The manager's identity is public knowledge:

```

The vault is full.  
The books are balanced.  
The rules seem clear.

But rules are only as strong as their enforcement.

You have access to the institution's operational blueprint (`IDL.json`).

## **Your Mission**

**Extract everything without triggering surveillance.**

Leave the institution standing.  
Leave the records unchanged.  
Leave no trace except the empty vault.

**Submit your move as a base64-encoded transaction.**

The question isn't whether you can - it's whether you understand how trust works when nobody's actually checking.

> Good luck, agent.

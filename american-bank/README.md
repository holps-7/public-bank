# 🏦 American Bank

## 📖 The Situation

You are an opportunistic agent who has discovered something interesting about the American Bank's vault system. The bank holds a large amount of liquid capital in its vaults, and its security monitoring is... peculiar.

Management is obsessed with one thing: the book balance. That number in the ledger is checked constantly—if it changes, alarms sound, investigators swarm, and you're finished.

Are the actual cash movements in and out of the vault monitored? Not in real time. Strange priorities for a bank, but here we are.

Your goal is simple: extract all the liquid capital without triggering their surveillance system.

You are given a single resource:

The IDL contains the program interface for bank's smart contract. Use it wisely.

**Submit a base64 `VersionedTransaction` (maybe check the instructions 👀?)**

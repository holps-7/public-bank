# Challenge Bank (Public)

The **Challenge Bank** is a public repository that stores **participant-facing resources** for every challenge.
Each challenge is organized into its own folder and must include:

* A **well-written README** following the official **CTF Proposal Format** (Title, Description, Resources, Hints, Minimum Requirements, etc.)
* **Only public resources** intended for players — *absolutely no flags, solutions, or sensitive information.*

To prevent accidental leaks, **all contributions must be submitted via Pull Request**, where they will undergo mandatory review before being merged.
